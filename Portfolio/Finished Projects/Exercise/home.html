    <h2>About myself</h2>

    <p> I'm a student at Codetelligence, I live in khayelitsha in a surburb called Mandela Park.

        and since then iv had alot of questions on my mind regarding to computers like: what is a computer?, 
        who created the first computer?, what is bios and how does it work?, what components make a motherboard?
        what's the purpose of a hard drive?, what equipment must you have in order to created a RAM?</p>
